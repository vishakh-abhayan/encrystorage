## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install encrystorage

## How to Use

```javascript
import SecureStorage from "encrystorage";

const encryptionKey = "your-secret-key";
const secureStorage = new SecureStorage(encryptionKey);

const sensitiveData = "sensitive information";
secureStorage.encryptAndSave(sensitiveData);

// Later, retrieve and decrypt the data
const decryptedData = secureStorage.getAndDecrypt();
console.log(decryptedData); // Output: 'sensitive information'
```
